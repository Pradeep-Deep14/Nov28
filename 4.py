def modify(n):

result=[modify(x) for x in data if x%4==0]

print(len(result))


#Answer is 2.

#How?????
#** Long story short, we are not printing result, just the length of result.

#➡️def modify(n):    
#            return n + 2

#This defines a function named modify that takes a parameter n and returns the result of adding 2 to n. Essentially, it's a simple function that adds 2 to its input.

#➡️result = [modify(x) for x in data if x % 4 == 0]

#This line uses a list comprehension. It iterates over each element x in the list data, applies the modify function to x if x is divisible by 4 (i.e., x % 4 == 0), and creates a new list result with the modified values. In this case, it will only modify the values 4 and 8 because they are the ones divisible by 4.

#So, after this line, result will be a list containing the modified values of 4 and 8. The modified value of 4 is 6 (4 + 2) and the modified value of 8 is 10 (8 + 2).

#➡️print(len(result))

#This line prints the length of the result list. In this case, the length will be 2 because there are two elements in the result list (6 and 10).
